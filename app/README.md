Known bugs:
1. Improve distance between a new task and the keyboard.
2. Remove the white padding in the TopAppBar when scrolling.
3. When pressing to add a new task, 
   if the task list is too big, it doesn't scroll to the end of the list automatically. 


Improvements:
1. When you click on create a todo item, you could press enter in the keyboard to add the new item already. 
2. Save the itens in a database.
3. Disable the buttons instead of just removing their onClick functions.
